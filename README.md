**Fake News Detection System**
**Project Description**
This project focuses on developing a Fake News Detection System using a combination of decision tree algorithms and natural language processing (NLP). The primary goal is to create a robust and accurate system capable of identifying misinformation in textual content. The solution is implemented in Python, utilizing Jupyter Notebooks for development and Streamlit for deployment.
**Motivation**
The rise of misinformation and fake news in the digital era poses a significant threat to public discourse and decision-making. This project aims to address this issue by providing a tool that can automatically identify and flag potentially false information. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the system contributes to the ongoing efforts to promote information integrity and combat the spread of misleading content.
